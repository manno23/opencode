Optimizes prompts using an AI model to improve their effectiveness before sending to target models.

This tool takes a prompt and uses a specialized optimizing model (typically GPT-4) to enhance it based on the specified optimization goal. The optimized prompt can then be used with other AI models for better results.

Usage:
- Provide the original prompt to optimize
- Optionally specify context about how the prompt will be used
- Choose the target model the optimized prompt will be sent to
- Select the optimization goal: clarity, specificity, efficiency, or comprehensiveness

The tool returns the optimized prompt along with metadata about the optimization process.
