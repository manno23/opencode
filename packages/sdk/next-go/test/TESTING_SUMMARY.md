# OpenCode Go SDK Testing Harness - Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive testing harness for the OpenCode Go SDK that includes unit tests, integration tests, and coverage tracking mechanisms. The harness is designed to work with both mock servers and live servers, and provides detailed reporting on API implementation progress.

## Files Created

1. `opencode_test.go` - Unit tests for core SDK functionality
2. `integration_test.go` - Integration tests with mock server implementation
3. `coverage_test.go` - Coverage tracking mechanisms and reporting
4. `scripts/test.sh` - Test execution script with coverage reporting
5. `TESTING.md` - Detailed documentation on the testing approach
6. `TESTING_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document

## Key Features of the Testing Harness

### 1. Unit Testing

- Tests for individual SDK functions without requiring a server
- Verification of client creation and parameter handling
- Error handling validation

### 2. Integration Testing

- Mock server implementation using `httptest` package
- Live server compatibility testing
- Test utility for checking server availability

### 3. Coverage Tracking

- Implementation coverage tracking (which API endpoints are implemented)
- Test coverage tracking (which implemented endpoints are tested)
- JSON and HTML coverage reports
- Percentage-based coverage metrics

### 4. Go Best Practices

- Table-driven tests for multiple test cases
- Subtests for organized test grouping
- Proper error reporting with context
- Clean test organization following Go conventions

## How to Run Tests

### Basic Test Execution

```bash
# Using the test script
./scripts/test.sh

# Direct Go command
go test -v ./...
```

### Coverage Testing

```bash
# Run tests with coverage
go test -v -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...

# Generate HTML coverage report
go tool cover -html=coverage.out -o coverage.html
```

## Mock Server Implementation

The integration tests include a mock server implementation that:

1. Simulates API endpoints using `httptest.Server`
2. Handles different HTTP methods (GET, POST)
3. Processes request parameters and body data
4. Returns appropriate JSON responses
5. Works without requiring a live server

## Coverage Tracking Features

The coverage tracking system:

1. Tracks total endpoints vs. implemented endpoints
2. Distinguishes between implemented and tested endpoints
3. Calculates coverage percentages
4. Saves reports in both JSON and HTML formats
5. Provides detailed endpoint-level tracking

## Integration Patterns Used

1. **Composition Pattern** - SDK wraps generated client rather than modifying it
2. **Mock Server Pattern** - Uses `httptest` for isolated testing
3. **Live Server Compatibility** - Tests can run against live servers when available
4. **Coverage Tracking** - Implementation progress monitoring
5. **Table-Driven Tests** - Organized test cases for better maintainability

## Test Organization

Tests follow Go conventions:

- File naming with `_test.go` suffix
- Function naming with `Test` prefix
- Clear error messages with expected vs. actual values
- Proper use of subtests and test helpers

## Future Enhancements

This testing harness provides a solid foundation that can be extended with:

- Additional test cases for more API endpoints
- Performance benchmarks
- Fuzz testing for edge cases
- More sophisticated mock server behaviors
- CI/CD integration for automated testing
